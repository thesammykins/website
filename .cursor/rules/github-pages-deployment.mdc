# Github Pages Deployment Rule

This project is a static website deployed via Github Pages. The deployment process and custom domain setup are as follows:

- The custom domain is specified in the [CNAME](mdc:CNAME) file at the project root. This file should contain the domain name used for the site.
- DNS for the custom domain is managed through Cloudflare. Ensure that the domain's DNS records (typically CNAME or A records) point to Github Pages as required by Github's documentation.
- Deployment is automated using Github Actions. The workflow configuration(s) can be found in the [.github/workflows/](mdc:.github/workflows) directory. These workflows handle building and publishing the site to Github Pages.

**To update the domain or deployment process:**
- Edit the [CNAME](mdc:CNAME) file for domain changes.
- Update workflow YAML files in [.github/workflows/](mdc:.github/workflows) for deployment changes.
- Adjust Cloudflare DNS settings as needed for domain or provider changes.
