# Github Pages Deployment Rule (Build-Enabled)

This project is a modern static website deployed via Github Pages. The deployment process and custom domain setup are as follows:

- The custom domain is specified in the [CNAME](mdc:CNAME) file at the project root. This file should be copied into the build output directory (e.g., `/docs` or `/dist`) for deployment.
- DNS for the custom domain is managed through Cloudflare. Ensure that the domain's DNS records (typically CNAME or A records) point to Github Pages as required by Github's documentation.
- Deployment is automated using Github Actions. The workflow(s) in [.github/workflows/](mdc:.github/workflows) must:
  - Run the build process (e.g., `npm run build` or equivalent)
  - Deploy the build output directory (not the repo root) to Github Pages
  - Ensure the deployed site matches the design language and style of [index.html](mdc:index.html)

**To update the domain or deployment process:**
- Edit the [CNAME](mdc:CNAME) file for domain changes.
- Update workflow YAML files in [.github/workflows/](mdc:.github/workflows) for build or deployment changes.
- Adjust Cloudflare DNS settings as needed for domain or provider changes.

// Updated for build-enabled, design-consistent GitHub Pages deployments.
